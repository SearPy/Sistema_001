2023-09-15T19-39-32: Net Status: low-level initialize success.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Note: this version (1/29/2017) has new data fields added
2023-09-15T19-39-32: time = time since start of game in ms.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: address = address of IP address
2023-09-15T19-39-32: incoming = total size of messages set to me in bytes. Spikes can indicate lag.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: outgoing = total size of messages set from me in bytes. Spikes can indicate lag.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: app_ctos = client to server bytes delta excluding overheads (app data only)
2023-09-15T19-39-32: app_stoc = server to client bytes delta excluding overheads (app data only)
2023-09-15T19-39-32: loss = number of packets lost. Can indicate lags.  Some node on the network is dropping packets or taking to long and we have to resend them.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: sent = number of packets sent. Spikes can indicate lag.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: ping = how long it takes for a packet to get back and forth. Spikes can indicate lag.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: variance = how much the ping is changing from avg ping. Spikes can indicate lag.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: reliable delayed = This occurs when we drop reliable packets from sending this frame because we are sending to much data. Unreliable are more likely to be dropped than reliable.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: unreliable delayed = This occurs when we drop unreliable packets from sending this frame because we are sending to much data.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: app update delayed = This occurs when the app is taking to long to run code caused by network packets (ie CPU) and packets are delayed until the next frame
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Time spent in critical section (frame) = This is the time the network thread is blocking the main thread from doing anything.
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Latency in Window = The average Latency in ms. of Reliable packets during this time slice
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Packet Loss percentage in Window = The packet loss percentage of Reliable packets during this time slice
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Jitter in Window = The average Jitter in ms. of Reliable packets during this time slice
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Overall Latency Min = The lowest Latency seen in ms. of Reliable packets up to this point in time
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Overall Latency Max = The largest Latency seen in ms. of Reliable packets up to this point in time
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Latency Min in Window = The lowest Latency seen in ms. of Reliable packets during this time slice
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Latency Max in Window = The largest Latency seen in ms. of Reliable packets during this time slice
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Latency packet samples = number of packets used in determining average latency from start of game
2023-09-15T19-39-32: Jitter packet samples = number of packets used in determining average jitter from start of game
2023-09-15T19-39-32: reconnect = flag to indicate one or more reconnects occurred
